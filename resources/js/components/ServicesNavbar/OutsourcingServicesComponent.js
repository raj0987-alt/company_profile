                        <p>Bangladesh is one of the Asia’s most attractive IT outsourcing destinations after India -
                            particularly for clients in the USA and other Anglophone countries. Bangladesh offers
                            significant cost advantages for IT outsourcing - both in terms of worker-wages as well as
                            cost of infrastructure. Now Bangladesh is fast becoming the next big destination in
                            outsourcing.</p>
